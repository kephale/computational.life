Privacy Policy</p>
<p>
The privacy of my visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.</p>
<p>
First and foremost, I will never share your email address or any other personal information to anyone without your direct consent.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Definitions</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The privacy policy of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine is based on the terms used by the European legislator in the adoption of the Basic Regulation on Data Protection (DSGVO). Our data protection declaration should be easy to read and understand both for the public and for our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to explain the terms used in advance.</p>
<p>
In this privacy policy we use the following terms, among others:</p>
<p>
personal data
  Personal data is all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as “data subject”). Identifiable is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by assignment to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more special characteristics that express the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
person affected
   Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data are processed by the controller.
Processing
   Processing means any operation or series of operations carried out with or without the aid of automated procedures relating to personal data, such as the collection, collection, organization, filing, storage, adaptation or modification, retrieval, querying, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or any other form of provision, reconciliation or linking, restriction, deletion or destruction.
Restricting processing
   Restriction on processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of restricting their future processing.
Pseudonymization
   Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be assigned to a specific data subject without additional information, provided that this additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures that ensure that the personal data is not assigned to an identified or identifiable natural person.
person in charge or person responsible for processing
   The controller or controller shall be the natural or legal person, authority, body, office or other body which alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data. Where the purposes and means of such processing are laid down by Union law or by the law of the Member States, the controller or the specific criteria for his appointment may be laid down in accordance with Union law or the law of the Member States.
Order processor
   Processor is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller.
receiver
   The recipient is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other body to which personal data is disclosed, whether or not it is a third party. However, authorities which may receive personal data under Union law or the law of the Member States within the framework of a particular investigation mandate shall not be regarded as recipients.
Thirds
   Third party is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other body other than the data subject, the data processor, the data processor and the persons authorised to process the personal data under the direct responsibility of the data processor or the data processor.
agreement
   Acceptance is any informed and unequivocal statement of intent, in the form of a statement or other clear affirmative act, voluntarily given by the data subject for the particular case, that the data subject indicates his or her consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her.</p>
<p>
II. Name and address of the person responsible</p>
<p>
The person responsible within the meaning of the Basic Data Protection Regulation and other national data protection laws of the member states and other data protection regulations is:</p>
<p>
Kyle Harrington
Robert Rössle St. 10
13125 Berlin
Germany</p>
<p>
Tel.: 030-94062195</p>
<p>
Website: www.kyleharrington.com</p>
<p>
III. Name and address of the data protection officer</p>
<p>
The data protection officer of the person responsible is:</p>
<p>
Kyle Harrington
Email: Datenschutz@kyleharrington.com
Website: www.kyleharrington.com</p>
<p>
IV. General information about data processing</p>
<p>
scope of processing of personal data</p>
<p>
We only process personal data of our users if this is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our contents and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place regularly only after consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for real reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</p>
<p>
Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Article 6(1)(a) of the EU Data Protection Ordinance (DSGVO) serves as the legal basis.</p>
<p>
For the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.</p>
<p>
To the extent that processing of personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Article 6(1)(c) DSGVO serves as the legal basis.</p>
<p>
In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Article 6(1)(d) DSBER serves as the legal basis.</p>
<p>
If processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the former interest, Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO serves as the legal basis for processing.</p>
<p>
3 – data erasure and storage time</p>
<p>
The personal data of the person concerned will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the person responsible is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Provision of the website and creation of log files</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>1 – description and scope of data processing</p>
<p>
Every time you visit our website, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the calling computer.</p>
<p>
The following data are collected:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internet Protocol addresses (IP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of browser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Date and time stamp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referring and exit pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of clicks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The data is also stored in the log files of our system. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.</p>
<p>
2 – legal basis for data processing</p>
<p>
The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para.1 lit. f DSGVO.</p>
<p>
3 – purpose of data processing</p>
<p>
The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the website to be delivered to the user’s computer. For this the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.</p>
<p>
The data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data serves us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>
<p>
In these purposes is also our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 para.1 lit. f DSGVO.</p>
<p>
4 – storage time</p>
<p>
The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose of its collection. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.</p>
<p>
The controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the time necessary to achieve the data retention purpose or as provided for by the European regulator or other legislator in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject.</p>
<p>
If the storage purpose is not fulfilled or if a storage period prescribed by the European Directive and Regulation Giver or another competent legislator expires, the personal data will be blocked or deleted routinely and in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>
<p>
5 – possibility of objection and elimination</p>
<p>
The collection of data to provide the website and the storage of data in log files is mandatory for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user.</p>
<p>
VI. Use of Cookies</p>
<p>
1 – description and scope of data processing</p>
<p>
Our website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in the Internet browser or by the Internet browser on the user’s computer system. If a user visits a website, a cookie may be stored on the user’s operating system. This cookie contains a characteristic character string that enables a unique identification of the browser when the website is called up again.</p>
<p>
When you visit this site cookies are stored on your computer to identify trusted traffic, which are used by the content network, Cloudflare. This prevents attacks and enables secure access to the website. For more information you can read Cloudflare’s privacy policy and terms of service.</p>
<p>
2 – legal basis for data processing</p>
<p>
The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO.</p>
<p>
3 – purpose of data processing</p>
<p>
The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to simplify the use of websites for users. Some functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For this it is necessary that the browser is recognized even after a page change.</p>
<p>
The user data collected by technically necessary cookies are not used to create user profiles.</p>
<p>
For these purposes, our legitimate interest also lies in the processing of personal data in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO.</p>
<p>
4 – Duration of storage, objection and elimination option</p>
<p>
Cookies are stored on the user’s computer and transmitted to our site by the user. Therefore, you as a user also have full control over the use of cookies. You can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it may no longer be possible to use all functions of the website in full.
Google Analytics</p>
<p>
Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. For more information you can read the Google Analytics Privacy Policy.
Rights of the person concerned</p>
<p>
If personal data are processed by you, you are affected by the DSGVO and you have the following rights against the person responsible:</p>
<p>
right to information</p>
<p>
You can ask the data controller to confirm whether personal data concerning you is being processed by us.</p>
<p>
If such processing exists, you can ask the person responsible to provide the following information:</p>
<p>
the purposes for which the personal data are processed;
the categories of personal data being processed;
the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal information about you has been or will be disclosed;
the planned duration of the storage of personal data concerning you or, if specific information on this is not possible, criteria for the determination of the storage period;
the existence of a right of rectification or deletion of personal data concerning you, of a right of limitation of the processing by the controller or of a right of objection to such processing;
the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority;
all available information on the origin of the data if the personal data is not collected from the data subject;
the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling in accordance with Articles 22(1) and (4) DSBER and - at least in these cases - meaningful information on the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject.</p>
<p>
You have the right to request information as to whether the personal data concerning you is transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. In this context, you may request to be informed of the appropriate guarantees in accordance with Art. 46 DSGVO in connection with the transmission.</p>
<p>
right to correction</p>
<p>
You have the right to correct and/or complete any personal data processed concerning you that is incorrect or incomplete. The person responsible shall make the correction without delay.</p>
<p>
right to limitation of processing</p>
<p>
You may request that the processing of personal data concerning you be restricted under the following conditions:</p>
<p>
if you dispute the accuracy of the personal data concerning you for a period of time that allows the data controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
the processing is unlawful and you refuse to delete the personal data and instead request the restriction of the use of the personal data;
the data controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims, or
if you have filed an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO and it has not yet been determined whether the legitimate reasons of the person responsible outweigh your reasons.</p>
<p>
If the processing of personal data concerning you has been restricted, such data may only be processed - apart from being stored - with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending rights or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or on grounds of an important public interest of the Union or a Member State.</p>
<p>
If the processing restriction is restricted according to the above conditions, you will be informed by the person responsible before the restriction is removed.</p>
<p>
right of deletion</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Duty to delete</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You may request the data controller to delete the personal data concerning you immediately and the data controller is obliged to delete this data immediately if one of the following reasons applies:</p>
<p>
The personal information about you is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.
You revoke your consent on which the processing was based in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a) of the DSGVO, and there is no other legal basis for the processing.
You file an objection against the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 DSBER and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for processing, or you file an objection against the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 2 DSBER.
The personal data concerning you has been processed unlawfully.
The deletion of personal data concerning you is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member States to which the data controller is subject.
The personal data concerning you have been collected in relation to information society services offered pursuant to Art. 8 para. 1 DSGVO.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Information to third parties</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the data controller has made the personal data concerning you public and is obliged to delete them in accordance with Article 17(1) of the DSGVO, he shall take appropriate measures, including technical measures, taking into account the technology available and the implementation costs, to inform data processors who process the personal data that you as the data subject have requested the deletion of all links to this personal data or of copies or replications of this personal data. c) Exceptions</p>
<p>
The right to cancellation does not exist if the processing is necessary</p>
<p>
for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information;
to fulfil a legal obligation required for processing under the law of the Union or of the Member States to which the controller is subject, or to perform a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority conferred on the controller;
for reasons of public interest in the field of public health in accordance with Article 9(2)(h) and (i) and Article 9(3) DSGVO;
for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes according to Art. 89 para. 1 DSGVO, insofar as the law mentioned under a) is likely to make it impossible or seriously impair the attainment of the objectives of such processing, or
for asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.</p>
<p>
right to information</p>
<p>
If you have exercised your right of rectification, deletion or limitation of processing against the controller, the controller is obliged to notify all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of such rectification or deletion or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.</p>
<p>
You have the right vis-à-vis the person responsible to be informed about these recipients.</p>
<p>
right to data transferability</p>
<p>
You have the right to receive the personal information about you that you have provided to the owner in a structured, common and machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to transmit this data to another person in charge without obstruction by the person in charge to whom the personal data was provided, provided</p>
<p>
the processing is based on a consent pursuant to Art. 6 para.1 lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9 para.2 lit. a DSGVO or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO and
processing is carried out using automated methods.</p>
<p>
In exercising this right, you also have the right to have the personal data concerning you transferred directly from one data controller to another data controller, insofar as this is technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons must not be affected by this.</p>
<p>
The right to data transfer shall not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority conferred on the controller.</p>
<p>
right of objection</p>
<p>
You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you in accordance with Article 6(1)(e) or (f) of the DSGVO, including profiling based on these provisions.</p>
<p>
The controller no longer processes the personal data concerning you unless he can prove compelling grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
<p>
If personal data concerning you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such advertising, including profiling, in so far as it is related to such direct marketing.</p>
<p>
If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for these purposes.</p>
<p>
You have the option of exercising your right of opposition in connection with the use of Information Society services through automated procedures using technical specifications, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC.</p>
<p>
right to revoke the data protection declaration of consent</p>
<p>
You have the right to revoke your data protection consent at any time. The revocation of consent shall not affect the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until revocation.</p>
<p>
right of appeal to a regulatory authority</p>
<p>
