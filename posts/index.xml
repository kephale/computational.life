      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m collecting some highlights of my emacs setup so I sound less like a crazy emacs person trying to convert other scientist.
This setup replaced my previous setup which involved:
 Google Keep for TODOs and random notes a Dropbox directory of markdown files with longer form notes from meetings and other random notes a directory of Jupyter notebook files + git repositories of notebooks (I do still use some of these for collaborative work)  It also enabled some new features:</description>

      <description>This is from work that I primarily did back when I was at HHMI Janelia in 2018-2019, but kept poking at for some time after that. This is based on the work we did in the SNT paper. The rendering itself is done in sciview. What you are seeing is an agent-based model of a neurodevelopment simulation (based on Cx3D) growing in an environment defined by an image. Since I designed this to work with SNT and ImageJ, it is completely possible to load a microscopy image in and run a similar simulation.</description>
